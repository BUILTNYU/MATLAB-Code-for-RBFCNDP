# MATLAB-Code-for-RBFCNDP
This is an implementation of Regis & Shoemaker's multi-start MSRBF algorithm for solving continuous network design problems, as discussed in the following paper: Chow, J.Y.J., Regan, A.C., Arkhipov, D.I., 2010. Fast converging global heuristic for continuous network design problem using radial basis functions. Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board 2196, 102-110. It's only been tested up to Anaheim network (note this version covers networks with centroids, so modifications are needed for a network without centroids (every node to every other node), and it would be nice to try this out on even larger networks (maybe with other CNDP variants like toll pricing problem).
